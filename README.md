# AI-Based-Litter-Detection-System-
This project is an automated litter detection system that uses Computer Vision and AI to identify trash in real-time. It utilizes an ESP32-CAM module for video streaming and a YOLOv8 model (converted to ONNX) for object detection. When litter is detected, the system automatically sends an alert with an image via WhatsApp.
